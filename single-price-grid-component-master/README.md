### What I learned
I am proud of:

```html
<div class="box">
      <div class="box-left">
        <h4>Monthly Subscription</h4>
        <p>$29<span>per month</span></p>
        <h5>Full access for less than $1 a day</h5>
        <a href="#" class="sign-up-btn">Sign Up</a>
</div>
```
```css
.text-container{
    background-color: white;
    padding: 37px;
    display: block;
    justify-content: center;
    overflow: hidden;
    width: 100%;
    border-top-right-radius: 5px;
    border-top-left-radius: 5px;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - This helped me for adding beautiful fonts. I really liked this site and will use it going forward.
- [Front end mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) - This is an amazing site which helped me finally understand how to make a grid component. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
